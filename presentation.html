            <H4>Poverty and Future of Food Production in Nigria</H4>
            
            <div class="text">
             <p>   
                Apart from the major poverty and employment problem which this project we help to fix significantly, the future of domestic food production in Nigeria is one major scenario that has been left almost unaddressed and this will undoubtedly hunt us as a nation if we do not act now. <br> 
                <br>
                Taking a critical look at the rate at which our population growth and urbanization, Nigeria may not be able to feed her citizens in less than next 20 years. Hunger and malnutrition may rampage the country, leaving more than almost halve our population helpless. <br> 
                <br>
                The world population is at present 7,754,853,827, Nigeria has over 203,581,064 of the population while Lagos State population is over 21 million. <br>
                <br>
                Like the rest of the world, Nigeria’s domestic food system is dangerously at risk if we don’t act because by 2050 the world’s population will reach 9.7 billion, about 34 percent higher than today. Nearly all of this population increase will occur in developing countries; Nigeria’s population will thus be about 402 million.  <br>
                <br>
                Urbanization will continue at an accelerated pace, and about 70 percent of the world’s population will be urban. The major growth in the Nigeria’s population will take place in Lagos State. Lagos State population will be over 33 million people. <br> 
                <br>
                How do we feed this large number of people?  In order to feed this larger, more urban, domestic food production must increase by an average of 70 percent. <br>
                <br>
                The major socio-economic factors that drive increasing food demand are population growth and increasing urbanization. Thus, Nigeria need to prioritize agriculture and the growing of food in more sustainable methods. If we don’t start now, we’ll have a problem sooner than the 2050, even by 2030, which will require significant imports, or food assistance. <br>
                <br>
                Unfortunately, food importation of food assistance will fail us because they may not be available because at the current rate of agricultural productivity growth in India, domestic food production in India will only be able to meet 59% of the country’s food demand by 2030. <br>
                <br><br>
                The United States of America will to be able to help with domestic food production’s capacity that will be able to feed just about 50% of her citizens if the present production capacity is not improved by almost 60%. <br>   
                <br>
                Moreover, the East Asia region will only make provision of 67% of domestic food requirement by 2030 if the current rate of food production capacity is the same in 2030. <br>
                <br>
               Sadly, considering our population growth and urbanization, the Sub-Sahara Africa is predicted to meet only 15% of food demand in 2030, which why agro-media is sacrosanct. <br>
                <br>
               It inviolable we apply workable and people oriented mix of practices, basically using media to drive agriculture practices with the focus of racing large congregation of agro-entrepreneurs. <br>
                <br>
               We have to create a culture of farming in Nigeria. We must think, dream and do farming if we must survive as people. Farming must be our art, culture, sport, entertainment, and vocation; and this can only be achieved through Agro-media.

           <h4>Agro-Media, an Intigrated Marketing communication tool</h4>
            <p>
               Agro-media entrepreneurial platform is an integrated marketing communication tool; it has the potency to achieve to:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                  Improved public profile of private and multinational companies within Nigeria which will result in more international customers, more suppliers and potential favor with decision makers in Nigeria. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    Give private and multinational companies a greater understanding of the issues facing young people in Nigeria and build national reputation and level of trust in the country.
                </li>
                <li>
                    New networking opportunities with greater access to publicity, particularly with the press.
                </li>

                   This will differentiate the private and multinational companies in the Nigerian competitive market, becoming number one for social responsibility by solving Nigeria socio-economy problems in grand style.
