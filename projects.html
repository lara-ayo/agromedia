                <h3>COMPONENTS OF AGRO-MEDIA</h3>
                    <h5>Youth Empowerment</h5>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="img/youth emp.jpg" alt="youth empowerment" width="70%">
                    </figure>
                   
                    <P>The project is designed to train twenty participants in the following areas:</P>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Cultivation, plaining and marketing</li>
                        <li>Agribusiness Entrepreneurship</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        At the end of the training, the participants will be empowered with fund to startup their respective farms, ranging from 1 million naira and maximum of 5 million naira as star prize.  
                    </p>


                    
                    <h5>Urban farming</h5>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="img/urban-farm.jpg" alt="Urban farming" width="70%">
                        </figure>
                    <P>
                        is one of the major components of this project, our on air training is design to advocate and seriously encourage urban farming in Nigeria, particularly in a very busy city like Lagos. <br> <br>

                        Agro-media is design to embark on serious practice of cultivating, processing and distributing food in and around urbanized areas and our activities and media driven agro-academy will involve animal husbandry, aquaculture, agroforestry, urban beekeeping, and horticulture.  <br> <br>

                        This media training will not only empower out in-house trainees but also our home audience. It will enable people living in the urbanized areas like Lekki, Ikoyi, Ajah, Surulere, festac, Magodo, Ogudu etc to grow there foods at home which will seriously enhance food security and make eating fresh and organic food a reality. <br> <br>

                        Our project will definitely help Lagosians to have direct access to fresh vegetables, fruits, and meat products and improve food security and food safety in Nigeria. <br> <br>

                        This is important because of our dependence on imported food and inorganic foods have to stop. During the First World War, President Woodrow Wilson of the United States of America encouraged Americans to embark on urban farming, because larger part of Europe was destroyed by the war. The European countries that used to be major food supplier to the United States were unable to produce sufficient food supplies to be shipped to the U.S., so urban farming was introduced as the new plan and was implemented with the intent to feed the U.S. and even supply a surplus to other countries in need. By the year 1919, over 5 million plots were growing food and over 500 million pounds of produce was harvested. <br> <br>

                        Also during the period of the Second World War, the United States Government set up a National Victory Garden Program that set up a mechanism for urban farming which as many as 5.5 million Americans participated in and over 9 million pounds of fruit and vegetables were grown a year, accounting for 44% of U.S.-grown produce throughout that time. <br> <br>

                        Thus, the future of sustainable food production in Nigeria here through Agro-media. We are doubtlessly a catalyst for food security, nutrition, and agro-economy in Nigeria.

                        <h5>Agroforestry</h5>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="img/agroforestory.jpg" alt="Agroforestry" width="70%">
                        </figure>
                    <p> 
                        which is focused on the land use management system in which trees or shrubs are grown in and around the urban cities also serious focus of this project. We are set to intentionally combine agriculture and forestry in both our rural and urban communities throughout the training and also influence our home audience everywhere to consciously embark on trees planning; this is our hope for biodiversity, reduced erosion and other adverse effects climate change. We are committed to seeing a nation with increased productivity, working economic, and more diversity in the ecological goods and services. <br> <br>

                        Agroforestry will significantly contribute to climate change mitigation along with adaptation benefits because trees cover account for more than 75% of global carbon pool. <br> <br>

                        The reality is that the adoption of agroforestry will drive carbon storage and increased livelihoods simultaneously among small-scale farmers and urban dwellers. This is the future we have been craving for.

            <h3>THE NEED OF MEDIA IN AGRIC SECTOR</h3>
            <p>
                Presently, media industry is the fastest growing industry in Nigeria. <br><br>

                Telecommunication and media industry generated $73 billion revenue in 2017. <br><br>

                The Nigeria media industry will generate an average of $2.8 billion between 2016 and 2021. <br><br>

                The need to grow our domestic food capacity with speed of light can easily be achieved through Agro-academy that must be media driven, the fastest growing industry in Nigeria. <br><br>

                The media will give us the platform to reach all of our target and ensure collective participation. <br><br>

                We have the responsibility of making Agricultural practice a lifestyle among Nigerians, this is the only way we can survive impending global food crisis and create the most talked about post oil economy. <br><br>

                It is therefore sacrosanct to drive agriculture through the fastest growing industry in Nigeria, the two industries would grow simultaneously.
